# Aimbot
External Aimbot for CS:GO on C++
To run the file just download the directory and open .sln file. Then build the solution and you are done.
The Aimbot works by interrupting file stream between front and back ends of the game. We modify inputs from our controls by considering ouputs from the game to the GPU.
